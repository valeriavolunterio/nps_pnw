DESCRIPTION

The primary objective of this project is to redesign the National Park Service (NPS) app, focusing on the Pacific Northwest administrative region. The preliminary app aims to address current challenges, including poor user experience, navigation issues, and limited offline capabilities. The redesign aligns with the NPS mission for education and conservation, providing visitors with an improved, region-specific app.


SCREENS

Home/Listing Screen: Displays a list of products available for purchase. Products can be filtered through the search bar. Each product displays its name, price, and image. There is conditional formatting for discounted items as well.

Product Screen: Displays the details of a selected product, including its name, price, image, and description.
Sell Item Screen: Includes a form component to collect information about the item the user wants to sell, such as name, description, price, and photos. It also has a checkbox to automatically add a 20% discount.


COMPONENTS

Our interactivity is designed to be intuitive, mirroring natural elements and providing users with a tactile and visually pleasing experience. These buttons collectively create a cohesive and visually appealing user interface that aligns with the
theme of bringing the colors of the Pacific Northwest to the screens. The use of different shades and textures helps in creating a natural and immersive experience for users interacting with the app.

Task Buttons- These buttons assist the user in completing a task or making progress completing a task in the scope of the app. They are designed in a cohesive manner, with a consistent color scheme and iconography. Toggled Buttons switch states to display
active/inactive status. Action Buttons Illicit a response within the same screen. Shortcut Buttons streamline user task flows by directly navigating to another screen with relevant parameters applied.

Tab Bar Buttons- This provides the user with quick and easy access to different features and information related to the park.
The buttons are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Tab buttons appear in a consistent, familiar manner
with specific calls to action. This allows the user to effectively navigate the intricacies of each park by making clear selections. The button size and color are designed to catch the user’s attention to explore the information offered.

Switches- Like toggled buttons, switches are designed to provide immediate feedback that display an active/inactive status.
Switches are used News, Events, and Park Alerts screens to filter by favorite parks. Switches are also used to turn “Dark Mode” and “High Contrast” visual modes on in the settings.

Toggles- The toggle component allows users to view parks or places they have either bookmarked, favoritedor have recently viewed in the app. The user is able to swipe or tap to toggle between parks or
places. Toggles are differentiated from switches because they do not use “on/off” states, but change information delivered. If expanded, toggles could also be used to switch between units of distance or currency.

Park Card Carousel
This feature provides users with easy access to view new parks, favorited parks or bookmarked parks from the home screen of the app. The component also creates a sense of exploration and discovery, as users can swipe through different cards and find new parks to visit or learn about. The component is intuitive and user-friendly, as users can swipe left or right to navigate the cards, and tap on the button to perform an action. The component also provides visual feedback and affordance, as the cards have a slight 3D effect and a
shadow to indicate their position and movement. The component is designed to match the theme and content of the app, and to inspire users to enjoy the natural and historical attractions of the NPS Pacific Northwest Region.

Cards
Cards are used throughout the app to break up content and make it more easily digestible. It also allows the dynamically generated content to be easily organized into chunks. The cards create visual hierarchy allowing the viewer to focus on the most prevalent information and action. Cards always use Parchment as the flood color. Each card features its own subheadings, content,
and other features. There is a structured card for every use case. Some examples are listed here.

This component can be used to create filters for the different types of national parks, amenities,
experiences and places. For example, the user can tap on the header Parks to see a list of
checkboxes for the different parks in the region, such as National Park, National Reserve, National Monument, etc. The user can then select one or more parks to filter their search results. Similarly, the user can tap on the headers
Amenities , Experiences , and Places to see and select the options for each category.
This type of component enhances user experience by allowing them to customize their search and find what they are looking for more easily and quickly. The component also saves space on the screen by hiding the content that is not
relevant or needed at the moment. The component also provides visual feedback and affordance to the user by changing the shape or color of the header when it is expanded or collapsed.

DEPENDENCIES

AsyncStorage: Used to store the product listings. Will also add user and cart information.
